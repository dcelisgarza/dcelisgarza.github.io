[Resume](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/dcelisgarza.github.io/blob/master/Daniel_Celis_Garza_resume.pdf)

I'm from [Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tampico,+Tamaulipas,+Mexico/@22.2663158,-97.9045051,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x85d7fd8bfcfe2d1f:0xc3189ac39db089e6!8m2!3d22.2331041!4d-97.861099?hl=en).

When I was 12, my family and I moved to [Bradford, West Yorkshire, England](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bradford/@53.7969118,-1.7701047,14.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x48795f7ae9c21919:0x8fe0edd83227194f!8m2!3d53.795984!4d-1.759398?hl=en) for four years.

We moved back to Tampico just in time for the drug war to happen...

I studied a BSc. in Chemistry at [ITESM, Campus Monterrey, Mexico](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tecnol%C3%B3gico+de+Monterrey/@25.6515649,-100.2917287,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8662bfcee61c0709:0xab5b4cc298e6fe08!8m2!3d25.6515649!4d-100.28954?dcr=0).

During that time I did a summer internship with [Prof. Anatoly B. Kolomeisky](http://python.rice.edu/~kolomeisky/), published a [paper](http://python.rice.edu/~kolomeisky/articles/J.stat.mech_P04013.pdf) and wrote the code found in [ASEP](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/ASEP) (along other unreleased codes) as a result.

I wrote my thesis in non-adiabatic quasiclassical chemical physics under the supervision of [Prof. John F. Stanton](https://sites.google.com/site/stantonresearchgroup/home). The public release can be found in my [BSc_Thesis](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/BSc_Thesis) repository.

I am currently a second year in the [DPhil in Science and Technology of Fusion Energy](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/science-and-technology-fusion-energy?wssl=1) programme (Materials PhD) at the University of Oxford. It's pretty great.

My work is in [Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Modelling](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0ahUKEwiA_sHI34TYAhUBcRQKHcoFBxYQFghIMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783319334783-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-1586709-p179957644&usg=AOvVaw3DEvPZJ2TCIg4swn9s-Sko) in 3D (3D DDD), where so far I've been working on coupling them to Finite Element Models (FEM). The aim is to extend to modelling multicrystalline materials, more complex geometries, and account for diffusion. For my work I use C, CUDA C and Matlab. However, I've used Python, C++ and Fortran (Modern Fortran is my favourite) in past projects. I'm being supervised by Ed Tarleton and Angus Wilkinson.

I'm interested in High Performance and Scientific Computing, Mathematical Modelling, and Applied & Computational Maths. I'm a black belt in [Shotokan Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan)
